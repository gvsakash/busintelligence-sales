##### Dimensionality reduction using PCA (on wiki):

>    * The main linear technique for dimensionality reduction, PCA performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower-dimensional
space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. 
>    * In practice, the covariance (and sometimes the correlation) matrix of the data is constructed and the eigenvectors 
on this matrix are computed. The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) 
can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. 
>    * Moreover, the first few eigenvectors can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of 
the system. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but 
hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors.
