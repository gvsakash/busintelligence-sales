## Business Intelligence for Sales Prediction 
(Supervisor: Dr. T V Rajinikanth)

######     ~ final code to be added after publication.

* Tasks implemented:  Dimensionality reduction using PCA, Data Extraction and classification using SVM architecture.
* Implemented machine learning models in domain of business intelligence to explore customer purchase and behavior patterns in 1,40,000 records across 13 attributes. Tested with SVM and random forest classifiers after dimensionality reduction and visualized the predictions / outputs for sales patterns.
* Paper currently in proceedings to International Journal and will be communicated after submission. Final code used will be added after publication.

**Footnotes**
>    * The main linear technique for dimensionality reduction, PCA performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower-dimensional
space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. 
>    * In practice, the covariance (and sometimes the correlation) matrix of the data is constructed and the eigenvectors 
on this matrix are computed. The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) 
can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. 
>    * Moreover, the first few eigenvectors can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of 
the system. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but 
hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors.
